### Quick start

You need the official server files before starting. Choose one:

- **Manually copy** from your Launcher installation:
  ```
  Windows: %appdata%\Hytale\install\release\package\game\latest
  Linux: $XDG_DATA_HOME/Hytale/install/release/package/game/latest
  MacOS: ~/Application Support/Hytale/install/release/package/game/latest
  ```
- **Use the Hytale Downloader CLI**

Copy the downloaded `Server/` directory and `Assets.zip` into your mapped `/data` folder, then start the container. You'll be prompted to log in.

Enjoy
